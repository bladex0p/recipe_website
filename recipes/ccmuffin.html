        <h3>Recipe description</h3>
        <p>Carrot cake meets muffins in this healthy breakfast recipe. Whole-wheat pastry flour 
            along with plenty of carrots and toasted walnuts add fiber while applesauce keeps the 
            muffins moist and helps cut back on sugar.</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 ¾ cups whole-wheat pastry flour</li>
                <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
                <li>1 ½ teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon ground ginger</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>2 large eggs</li>
                <li>½ cup unsweetened applesauce</li>
                <li>½ cup light brown sugar</li>
                <li>¼ cup granulated sugar</li>
                <li>½ cup plain whole-milk Greek yogurt, plus 2 tablespoons, divided</li>
                <li>1 ½ cups grated carrots (about 3 medium carrots)</li>
                <li>½ cup toasted chopped walnuts</li>
                <li>⅓ cup unsifted confectioners' sugar</li>
                <li>½ ounces reduced-fat cream cheese, softened</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Step 1</li>
                <p>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners; coat with cooking spray.
                     Set aside. Whisk flour, baking powder, cinnamon, baking soda, ginger and salt in a medium bowl. 
                     Whisk eggs, applesauce, brown sugar, granulated sugar and 1/2 cup yogurt in a large bowl; fold in 
                     carrots, walnuts and half of the flour mixture until combined. Add the remaining flour mixture; fold 
                     until just incorporated (some lumps can remain).</p>

                <li>Step 2</li>
                <p>Fill the prepared muffin cups three-quarters full with batter (about 1/3 cup each). Bake until the muffins 
                    are golden and a wooden pick inserted in the centers comes out clean, about 18 minutes. Transfer to a wire 
                    rack; let cool completely, about 20 minutes.</p>

                <li>Step 3</li>
                <p>Whisk confectioners' sugar, cream cheese and the remaining 2 tablespoons yogurt in a small bowl; whisk 
                    in 2 to 3 teaspoons water to reach desired frosting consistency. Dollop and spread the frosting over the 
                    cooled muffins.</p>

            </ol>

            <h2>Tips</h2>
            <p>To make ahead: Wrap airtight and refrigerate for up to 2 days. To freeze, wrap unfrosted muffins tightly 
                in plastic wrap or foil; freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw completely before frosting.</p>
