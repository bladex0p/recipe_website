        <h3>Recipe description</h3>
        <p>Lasagna is <strong>a wide, flat sheet of pasta.</strong> Lasagna can refer to either the type of 
            noodle or to the typical lasagna dish which is a dish made with several 
            layers of lasagna sheets with sauce and other ingredients, such as meats and cheese, 
            in between the lasagna noodles.</p>

        <p>It is usually <strong>rectangular or ribbon shaped, thicker than tagliatelle, made from a dough based on flour and eggs,</strong> 
            with numerous local variants. After being boiled, the rectangular lasagna noodles are drained and placed in layers
            with a filling that varies based on different local traditions.</p>
