        <h3>Recipe description</h3>
        <p>Lasagna is <strong>a wide, flat sheet of pasta.</strong> Lasagna can refer to either the type of 
            noodle or to the typical lasagna dish which is a dish made with several 
            layers of lasagna sheets with sauce and other ingredients, such as meats and cheese, 
            in between the lasagna noodles.</p>

        <p>It is usually <strong>rectangular or ribbon shaped, thicker than tagliatelle, made from a dough based on flour and eggs,</strong> 
            with numerous local variants. After being boiled, the rectangular lasagna noodles are drained and placed in layers
            with a filling that varies based on different local traditions.</p>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Step 1</strong></li>
                <p>To prepare meat sauce: Heat oil in a large heavy pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. 
                    Add sausage and cook, breaking up clumps, until browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium. 
                    Add onions and carrot; cook, stirring, until softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Add mushrooms and garlic; 
                    season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, until mushroom liquid evaporates, 4 to 6 minutes.</p>

                <li><strong>Step 2</strong></li>
                <p>Stir in wine, plum tomatoes, sun-dried tomatoes, oregano, basil, thyme and crushed red pepper. 
                    Bring to a simmer; reduce heat to low, cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 45 minutes. 
                    Uncover and cook, stirring frequently, until the sauce is very thick, 30 to 45 minutes more. 
                    Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.</p>

                <li><strong>Step 3</strong></li>
                <p>To prepare filling & assemble lasagna: Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
                    Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Coat a 9-by-13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.</p>

                <li><strong>Step 4</strong></li>
                <p>Cook noodles until just tender, about 10 minutes or according to package directions. Drain, 
                    then cool by plunging noodles into a large bowl of ice-cold water. Lay the noodles out on kitchen towels.</p>

                <li><strong>Step 5</strong></li>
                <p>Season ricotta with salt, pepper and nutmeg. Spread about 1 1/2 cups meat sauce in the prepared pan. 
                    Layer 3 noodles on top. Spread another 1 cup sauce over the noodles. Dot about 2/3 cup ricotta over 
                    the sauce, then sprinkle with 1/4 cup mozzarella and 2 tablespoons Parmesan. Continue layering the noodles, 
                    sauce and cheeses, finishing with the sauce, mozzarella and Parmesan. Sprinkle with parsley; cover with foil.</p>

                <li><strong>Step 6</strong></li>
                <p>Bake the lasagna until the sauce is bubbling, 35 to 40 minutes. Uncover and bake until golden, 5 to 10 minutes more. 
                    Let cool for 10 minutes before cutting.</p>
            </ol>
